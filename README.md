### Hi there, I'm Vladimir 👋

I'm an aspiring researcher interested in Computer Vision. Currently I am:

🔍 A research assistant @ U of Oxford: ETL, data cleaning and exploratory data analysis for a Finance project. ~100 million entries.
📚 A master student @ U of Bonn: a research-focused CS program. GPA 1.5.
📃 An independent researcher: working on a paper on ASMR in service experience (CX). > 2.5k respondents.

🚈 So I'm interested in research beyond my computer science pursuits. That is thanks to a bit of variety in my previous experience:
- BSc in CS in Russia.
- Moved to Bulgaria and studied an MBA
- Built and managed a web scraper for an Economics research
- Moved to Germany to study CS masters
- Worked as a research assistant at U of Bonn on a Computer Vision project

📈 As for my future, I hope to work as a researcher in AI in a team with high real-world impact. Some day I would also love to try myself in a more strategic, product-oriented role in AI.

🏃 In my free time you can find me running, biking or enjoying art: music, books, films
