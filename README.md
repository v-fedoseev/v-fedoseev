### Hi there, I'm Vladimir 👋

I'm a research assistant / master student, and I study Computer Vision. I'm also interested in Finance (common ownership) and Business (service design, consumer experience). I'm based in Germany and currently I am:

🔍 A research assistant @ U of Oxford: parsing, data cleaning and exploratory analysis for a Finance project. (~100 million data points);

📚 A master student @ U of Bonn: a research-focused CS program. (current GPA 1.47);

📃 A business research beginner: first reject with a paper on [ASMR in service experience](https://asmruniversity.com/tag/vladimir-fedoseev/). (> 2.5k respondents).

🚈 What I did before:
- BSc in CS in Russia;
- MBA in Bulgaria;
- Wrote 20+ data collectors / web scrapers for various research and business.
- Worked as an RA at U of Bonn on a Computer Vision project.

📈 As for my future, I hope to work as an AI researcher in a team with high real-world impact. Some day I would also love to try myself in a more strategic, product-oriented role.

🏃 In my free time you can find me running, biking or enjoying music, a book or a film.
