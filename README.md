### Hi there, I'm Vladimir 👋

I'm an aspiring researcher studying Computer Vision. I'm also interested in Finance (common ownership) and Business (service design, consumer experience). I'm based in Germany and currently I am:

🔍 A research assistant @ U of Oxford: parsing, data cleaning and exploratory analysis for a Finance project. ~100 million entries;

📚 A master student @ U of Bonn: a research-focused CS program. GPA 1.5;

📃 An independent researcher: first reject with a paper on [asmruniversity.com/tag/vladimir-fedoseev/](ASMR in service experience). > 2.5k respondents.

🚈 So I'm interested in research beyond my computer science pursuits - thanks to my previous experience:
- BSc in CS in Russia;
- MBA in Bulgaria (honors);
- Built a web scraper for an Economics research (500k entries daily from 8 sources);
- Worked as an RA at U of Bonn on a Computer Vision project.

📈 As for my future, I hope to work as a researcher in a team with high real-world impact. Some day I would also love to try myself in a more strategic, product-oriented role in AI.

🏃 In my free time you can find me running, biking or enjoying art: music, books, films.
