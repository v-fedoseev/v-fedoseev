### Hi there, I'm Vladimir 👋

I'm studying Computer Vision. I'm based in Germany and currently I am:

🔍 Writing my master thesis in Computer Vision @ Bosch;

📚 A master student @ U of Bonn: a research-focused CS program;

📃 RA @ U of Oxford: parsing, data cleaning and exploratory analysis for a Finance project;

_____
🚈 What I did before:
- RA at U of Bonn on a Computer Vision project;
- Wrote 20+ data collectors / web scrapers for various research and business;
- MBA in Bulgaria (currently turning the [thesis on ASMR in service experience](https://asmruniversity.com/tag/vladimir-fedoseev/) into a paper)
- BSc in CS in Russia.

📈 As for my future, I hope to work as Research Scientist in a team with high real-world impact. I find many industries very rewarding, but most of all I would love to contribute towards:

- increasing health span / fighting aging with AI, so people live longer and healthier
- investigating and analysing injustice and dictatorship with data, so people are more free and safe
- fighting climate change, pollution and overproduction, so people live more sustainably
- advancing ai in general, so people have more time and resources to be human and creative.

🏃 In my free time you can find me running, biking or enjoying music, a book or a film.
