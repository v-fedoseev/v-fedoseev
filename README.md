### Hi there, I'm Vladimir 👋

I'm studying Computer Vision. I'm based in Germany and currently I am:

🔍 Writing my master thesis in Computer Vision @ Bosch;

📚 A master student @ U of Bonn: a research-focused CS program. (current GPA 1.65);

📃 A business research beginner: first reject with a paper on [ASMR in service experience](https://asmruniversity.com/tag/vladimir-fedoseev/). (> 2.5k respondents).

🚈 What I did before:
- RA at U of Oxford: parsing, data cleaning and exploratory analysis for a Finance project;
- RA at U of Bonn on a Computer Vision project;
- Wrote 20+ data collectors / web scrapers for various research and business;
- MBA in Bulgaria;

📈 As for my future, I hope to work as an AI researcher in a team with high real-world impact. I find many industries very rewarding, but most of all I would love to contribute towards:

a) increasing health span / fighting aging with AI, so people live longer and healthier

b) investigating and analysing injustice and dictatorship with data, so people are more free and safe

c) fighting climate change, pollution and overproduction, so people live more sustainably

d) advancing ai in general, so people have more time and resources to be humane and creative.
🏃 In my free time you can find me running, biking or enjoying music, a book or a film.
